# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with extensive datasets and provides a solution to improve rendering efficiency.

## Problem

The provided `FlatListBug.js` showcases a `FlatList` implementation with a substantial dataset.  On lower-end devices or with exceptionally large datasets, scrolling becomes sluggish, and the app may freeze.

## Solution

`FlatListBugSolution.js` presents optimized rendering strategies. This includes using techniques like `keyExtractor`, `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `getItemLayout`, and potentially `windowSize` to reduce re-renders and improve scrolling smoothness.
